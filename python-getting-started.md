# Development environment

[Python](https://www.python.org) programming language is used to explore some of the datasets and API endpoints that are publicly available. In addition, several popular libraries were installed and the complete list of packages can be found in [environment.yaml](./environment.yaml) file that can be used with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) package manager to reproduce it. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Integrated Development Environment was used for development.

Following list of links to tools and tutorials might help newcomers to learn data science using Python:

- Python 3.9.7 -- you can download and install Python for your platform [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). [Learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) is a very good learning resource for getting started with Python.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html) and other packages can be installed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), or any other package manager.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an Integrated Developmnet Environment (IDE) that makes the programming easier with [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/#meet-intellisense), Debug, and range of helpful extensions. However, any file editor can be used to modify the python source code.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) version control -- using version control is a good practice with any programming task.
- Starting points for learning [numpy for data science](https://realpython.com/numpy-tutorial/), or [pandas for data science](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/pandas-data-science/).
