Set of resources to support participants accessing external data sources.

## Office for National Statistics (ONS)

[ONS Time series explorer](https://www.ons.gov.uk/timeseriestool) contains over 53k time series datasets. The data can be downloaded in common formats, such as csv, which can be used for further data visualisation and analysis.

[00-ons-example.ipynb](exploratory/00-ons-example.ipynb) is a Jupyter notebook that loads two datasets sourced from ONS: Air emissions All greenhouse gases-Total-Thousand tonnes CO2 equivalent and Passenger Air Transport Services and loads necessary libraries, reads data and plots a simple visualisation.

## Met Office

[Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) is the UKâ€™s national meteorological service providing weather services and climate information. [This guide](data/met-office-data-guide.md) describes how to access historic weather station data, the 18 Petabytes CEDA Archive, and how to access the forecast and observation data.
